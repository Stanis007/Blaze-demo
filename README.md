# Blaze-demo

Successfully completed a simple performance testing project in JMeter using BlazeMeter.

I have used https://blazedemo.com/ for this 

To record the Test cases  I have used Tool- Blazemeter 

To evaluate the performance and scalability of the flight booking system under various load conditions to ensure optimal user experience and system reliability.

Scenario Description:

User Login: Simulate concurrent user logins to the flight booking platform. (Here login did'nt work so I directly did the next step) 

Search Flights:  origin, destination, date, number of passengers 

Select Flight: Simulate users selecting a flight from the search results.

Enter Passenger Details: Enter passenger information (e.g., name, contact details) for the selected flight.

Payment Processing: Initiate payment processing for the flight booking.

Confirmation: Validate the confirmation of the booking and completion of the transaction.

Logout: Simulate user logout from the system.

After the performance testing is done in Blazemeter ,the report is downloaded in chart form.
